Project Title: CROW – AI-Powered Case Management Assistant

1. Introduction:<br>
The Community Action Agency of Western Connecticut (CAAWC) provides essential services to vulnerable and low-income communities. However, staff face significant administrative challenges due to outdated systems, manual tracking, and limited access to data insights. Our team created CROW (Can Reduce Our Workload)—an all-in-one AI assistant designed to modernize case management without disrupting existing workflows.

2. Problem:<br>
High administrative burden from manual tracking and documentation
Poor integration with legacy systems
Limited data-driven insights for client care
No central system for compliance and task reminders

3. Solution:<br> CROW<br>
CROW is an AI-powered digital assistant that integrates seamlessly with CAAWC’s current tools (Outlook, Excel, Zoom) and supports staff in four key areas:
Meeting Transcription & Summarization
Automatically transcribes bi-monthly Zoom meetings using Blue Sky AI and emails summaries to all participants, ensuring institutional memory and alignment.
Compliance Tracking
Parses task-related emails and updates dynamic Excel files to monitor client deadlines, sending daily alerts for tasks due soon—all using anonymized client IDs.
Image-to-Excel Conversion
Allows staff to drag-and-drop images (e.g., handwritten forms or notes) into the system. CROW uses OCR (via pytesseract) to extract data and auto-fill Excel sheets.

4. Key Advantages<br>
No Cost: Built entirely with free/open-source tools
No Disruption: Works within existing infrastructure
Privacy First: Uses anonymized internal IDs only
Scalable: Ready to expand to other agencies or departments
Time-Saving: Reduces manual workload and cognitive overhead

5. Next Steps:<br>
Finalize pilot deployment of CROW at CAAWC
Train staff on its features and workflows
Conduct a privacy/compliance review
Build a dashboard to monitor outcomes and usage metrics

6. Conclusion<br>
CROW demonstrates how a thoughtful, integrated AI solution can empower nonprofit staff, improve efficiency, and elevate care delivery—without requiring expensive systems or major change management.
